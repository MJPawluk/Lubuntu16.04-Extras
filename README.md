# Lubuntu16.04-Extras
Here I want to share some code to make Lubuntu 16.04 a little bit more comfortable.

##About the "empty_trash_menu" script:

  In Lubuntu 16.04 there is no option to empty the trash if you right-click on it.
  This script downloads all the necessary packages and implements this function to your system.
  I hope it works for you as it worked for me.

  ###Usage:
    1. Download the file.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the same directory you downloaded
        the script to.
    3. Make the file executable with "sudo chmod u+x "empty_trash_menu.sh"
    4. Execute the script with "./empty_trash_menu.sh"


##About the "terminal_transparency" script:

  The default terminal in Lubuntu 16.04 is LXTerminal. I find it very helpful to have
  a transparent terminal because it not only looks somehow cool but it makes working
  with it easier. At least for me.

  ###Usage:
    1. Download the file.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the same directory you downloaded
      the script to.
    3. Make the file executable with "sudo chmod u+x "terminal_transparency.sh"
    4. Execute the script with "terminal_transparency"
